npm run start:prod - To run the production mode application
After running this, go to postman which helps to build and use api. So you can test the CRUD operation in the postman.

The development and production modes are done with the help of webpack. Webpacke is a module which helps to bundle all the different modules,files into a single file which helps to reduce the load on the application and improves the performance.
So this allows the developer to work with the development mode while ensuring that the optimized output is used in production mode.
